    <h1>Capture the Flag!</h1>
    <div>
        CTF in computer security is an exercise in which "flags" are secretly hidden in purposefully-vulnerable programs or websites.
          Competitors steal flags either from other competitors or from the organizers.
            Several variations exist, including hiding flags in hardware devices.
            Competitions exist both online and in-person, and can be advanced or entry-level.
          The game is based on the traditional outdoor sport of the same name.
        Flags are often stylised with a combination of letters and numbers such as FYC2022{y0u_h@v3_f0uND_th3_fl@G!}.

        Security CTFs are usually designed to serve as an educational exercise to give participants experience in securing a machine.
          Often, the tasks involve conducting and reacting to the sort of attacks found in the real world.
            Classic CTF activities include reverse-engineering, packet sniffing, protocol analysis, programming, cryptoanalysis among others.
            In an attack/defense style competition, each team is given a machine to defendâ€”typically on an isolated competition network.
            Teams are scored on both their success in defending their machine and on their success in attacking the other team's machines.
        A variation from classic flag-stealing is to "plant" own flags on opponent's machines.

        Hardware challenges usually involve getting an unknown piece of hardware, figuring out how to bypass part of the security measures.
            Examples include using debugging ports or using a side-channel attack.
          Jeopardy-style competitions are closer to programming competitions.
            The teams do not directly attack each other, but rather solve challenges posed by the organizers.
          Time is generally not a factor in scoring these competitions, but "first blood" bonus points are often given to the first solver.
        They are extremely interesting to take part in.

        Wargame is another cybersecurity challange played by many people.
            In hacking, the competitors must exploit a system or application, or gain or prevent access to a computer system.
            A wargame usually involves a CTF logic, based on pentesting, URL attacks, password cracking, scripting, IP address spoofing etc.
            Wargames are also used as a method of cyberwarfare preparedness.
        The NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence holds an annual event, Locking Shields, which is a live-fire cyber exercise.

        Encoding techniques are often mixed with questions in such events.
            Encoding is the process of converting data from one form to another.
            We can encode the characters of the alphabet into different forms depending on the technique.
            It is not necessary to encoded characters using characters only, one can always use symbols for the same purpose.
        Who knows, the above text might have something to do with the question in hand.

        There is nothing of much importance here.
          If you are really going to look, look carefully somewhere else within the same file.
            That is not to say, that the text here has no significance, it is indeed important.  
          The hidden text in file is almost there.
          Maybe viewing this file in a different way might help, the sentences do seem oddly structured.
        Best of luck!
